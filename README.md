## Installation (It's a snap!)
Just simply run:
```bash
npm install flowjs
```

## How to Use It 

1. **Import FlowJS into your project:**

```js
import flow from 'flowjs';
```

2. **Create an Game instance:**

```js
class MyGame extends flow.Game {
  async onCreate() {
    //...creation code here...
  }
  
}
```

3. **Load your assets:**
 
 ```js
 await engine.loadAsset('./assets/player.png', 'player');
```

4. **Create your sprites:**

```js
class Player extends flow.Sprite {
  onCreate() {
    this.loadTexture("player");
  }
  onKeyPress(key) {
    if (key[0] == "right") this.changeVelocity(1, 0);
    if (key[0] == "left") this.changeVelocity(-1, 0);
    if (key[0] == "up") this.changeVelocity(0, -1);
    if (key[0] == "down") this.changeVelocity(0, 1);
  }
}
```
5. **Load your sprites**

```js
async onCreate() {
    //...other creation code here...
    this.addSprite(Player)
  }
  ```
6. **And start your game!**
```js
new flow.Engine({game:MyGame, window:{width:1280, height:720, title:"Game"}});
```
